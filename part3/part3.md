1. The bug in Part1 of the website portion was that the value obtained from both variables *num1* and *nu2* was being returned as a string. 
2. To fix this, I went ahead and wrapped both variable assignments utilizing the *parseInt()* function to obtain the actual number value instead of the string representation.
